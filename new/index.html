                            After each float we run the filtration system which will pump the water through a mechanical filter for at least three cycles while utilizing the combination of hydrogen peroxide and UV which helps remove potential pathogens from the water.

                            Always consult with your doctor first. Many pregnant women have claimed a greater sense of connection with their child during the float experience as well as relief from the constant pressure and strain on your body that growing a child can cause

                            This is a very common topic for first time customers. People that have had this worry going into their first float usually find that their sense of space is not bothered once inside the tank with the lights off. If you ever feel uncomfortable you can simply turn on the lights, stand up and get out of the tank to collect yourself.

							<h3> Connor Knabe </h3>
							<p>
                                Connor found out about floating back in 2012 when he was in Kansas visiting his cousin.  He was immediately intrigued and booked a float at the Spa at Briarcliff.  The next year when he was on vacation in Chicago he booked two more floats. After his 3rd experience he realized this was definitely something he wanted to make a part of his life.
                                <br><br>
                                He had this idea of starting a float center when he was at Mizzou finishing his IT degree.  Around this time Connor was going through a transition in his life, moving away from ways to escape and instead towards ways to accept life as it is.  Over the next few years he found peace in meditation and attened a 10 day silent meditation retreat, which changed the way he perceived the world in a positive way.
                                <br><br>
                                After he graduated from Mizzou he started working at Veterans United as a web developer and bought a Zen Float Tent for at home floating.  He started looking for spaces to open a float center here in Columbia and came across Noah who was using the same realtor.  Realizing they shared similar values and ideas about what a float center should be.  Naturally they decided opening a float center together made the most sense.

						<p>
                            Always aspiring to get the most out of life, Noah found floating to be the perfect tool for sensory reset and introspection. With constant sensory overload in our everyday lives from phones, computers, TV, etc., being able to jump into a float tank and truly rest your mind and body was very enticing.
                            <br><br>
                            After Noah’s first float, he was hooked! Pondering the installation of a personal tank in his home, Noah decided to look into bringing his passion for floating to central Missouri and opening his very own float center. A few months later he was on a plane flying out to Portland to go through a three day apprenticeship program with one of the most successful float shops in the country.
                            <br><br>
                            Bringing the immense amount of knowledge gained over those three glorious days in Portland, Noah began implementing his dream when he met Connor. Since then, they have eagerly been setting plans in motion to open the doors to what they believe to be the ideal shop for the floating experience. Living in Columbia for most of his life and getting so much out of the great experiences this community has to offer, Noah is thrilled to bring his passion for floating to the Columbia area to share with as many people as possible.

							<h3> Josh Ben</h3>
							<p>
                                Joshua grew up in the countryside of a small rural farm town in central Missouri. At
                                early age, he recognized a passion for the great outdoors and adventure. After high
                                school, Joshua attended college for a semester but felt unfulfilled in his academic
                                endeavors and his love for adventure led him into an Army recruiting center.
                                <br><br>
                                A year later Joshua was preparing for a deployment to Afghanistan with the 82nd
                                Airborne Division. 10 months into a 12 month deployment Joshua was severely injured.
                                during an engagement with Taliban. His injuries resulted in an amputation of a leg
                                PTSD and a long and strenuous road to recovery. After rehabilitation, Joshua’s
                                yearning for adventure reignited and he moved to Orlando to pursue a higher education
                                at the University of Central Florida.
                                <br><br>
                                Joshua's passion for Floating emerged while undergoing PTSD therapy in Orlando.
                                Medications were seemingly ineffective to contest the anxieties and depressions, a
                                friend suggested alternative methods of relaxation that could result in mindful clarity and
                                peace. This introduced Joshua to the wonderment of floating and an improved sense
                                well being. “Floating is liberating It’s an exceptional way to refresh and improve my
                                disposition.” - Joshua Ben

                        <h3>Thomas Blower</h3>
						<p>
                            Thomas was born and raised in Columbia, Missouri. The early years of his life were spent exploring the woods in his backyard, rocking out on his drum set, and building elaborate Lego fortresses. In the formative years of his early adolescence he was stricken with Crohn’s disease, which brought him to spend many grueling hours in doctors’ offices and hospitals. His teenage life was characterized by the throes of chronic illness, which he fiercely attempted to suppress, but to no avail.
                            <br><br>
                            His path to true healing began in his freshman year of college in an Honors Philosophy course which had but one main goal: to explore and better understand the nature of Love. Thomas soon discovered Buddhism and holistic medicine, which led him to make substantial changes in his lifestyle. He began to cultivate mindful awareness in his daily activities, and began to balance his physical, mental, and spiritual diets. Now a daily meditator, he has developed an ongoing practice of warmly embracing himself and others. A deliberate and conscious effort has been made in his life to shift from judging to appreciating, and to embrace adversity as his greatest teacher.
                            <br><br>
                            Thomas met Connor in a meditation group at Mizzou, and was immediately intrigued by the prospect of floating in sensory deprivation. He has since come to appreciate floating as a doorway to ever-deepening meditation and relaxation, and is excited to help share the numerous benefits with his local community.

               <h2 class="section-heading text-center">What is floating?</h2>
               <p class="lead">Imagine yourself, completely weightless, floating like a lily pad on water. As if laying on a cloud, in an almost zero-gravity state, the mind slowly dissolves into relaxation and tranquility. In the world of floating, there is nothing to do but be there, simply breathing and basking in quietude. Our tanks are specially designed to create a near zero-gravity state and limited sensory environment. These two characteristics create a unique experience that allows our body and mind to rest, heal, and grow.

                           After each float we run the filtration system which will pump the water through a mechanical filter for at least three cycles while utilizing the combination of hydrogen peroxide and UV, which helps remove potential pathogens from the water.

                           Always consult with your doctor first. Many pregnant women have claimed a greater sense of connection with their child during the float experience as well as relief from the constant pressure and strain on your body that growing a child can cause

                       <div class="faq-answer">
                           There are at least 800lbs of epsom salt in each tank which significantly increases the buoyancy and makes it nearly impossible for your body to fall below the surface of the water. You float with ease on your back.

                           This is a very common topic for first time customers. People that have had this worry going into their first float usually find that their sense of space is not bothered once inside the tank with the lights off. If you ever feel uncomfortable you can simply turn on the lights, stand up, and get out of the tank to collect yourself.

                               Connor found out about floating back in 2012 when he was in Kansas visiting his cousin.  He was immediately intrigued and booked a float at the Spa at Briarcliff.  The next year when he was on vacation in Chicago he booked two more floats. After his 3rd experience he realized this was definitely something he wanted to make a part of his life.
                               <br><br>
                               He had this idea of starting a float center when he was at Mizzou finishing his IT degree.  Around this time Connor was going through a transition in his life, moving away from ways to escape and instead towards ways to accept life as it is.  Over the next few years he found peace in meditation and attended multiple 10 day silent meditation retreats. On these retreats he started picturing what it would be like to own his own float tank.  This further encouraged him to follow his passion of starting a float center.
                               <br><br>
                               After he graduated from Mizzou he started working at Veterans United as a web developer and bought a Zen Float Tent for at home floating.  He started looking for spaces to open a float center here in Columbia and came across Noah who was using the same realtor.  Realizing they shared similar values and ideas about what a float center should be, they decided  that opening a float center together would be the most sensible/logical thing to do.

                           Always aspiring to get the most out of life, Noah found floating to be the perfect tool for sensory reset and introspection. With constant sensory overload in our everyday lives from phones, computers, TV, etc., being able to jump into a float tank and truly rest your mind and body was very enticing to him.
                           <br><br>
                           After Noah’s first float, he was hooked! Pondering the installation of a personal tank in his home, Noah decided to look into bringing his passion for floating to central Missouri by opening his very own float center. A few months later he was on a plane flying out to Portland to go through a three day apprenticeship program with one of the most successful float shops in the country.
                           <br><br>
                           Absorbing an immense amount of knowledge over those three glorious days in Portland, Noah began implementing his dream when he met Connor. Since then, they have eagerly been setting plans in motion to open the doors to what they believe to be the ideal shop for the floating experience. After living in Columbia for most of his life and getting so much out of the great experiences this community has to offer, Noah is thrilled to bring his passion for floating to the Columbia area to share with as many people as possible.

                               Joshua grew up in the countryside of a small rural farm town in central Missouri. At
                               an early age, he recognized a passion for the great outdoors and adventure. After high
                               school, Joshua attended college for a semester but felt unfulfilled in his academic
                               endeavors along with his love for adventure led him into an Army recruiting center.
                               <br><br>
                               A year later Joshua was preparing for a deployment to Afghanistan with the 82nd
                               Airborne Division. Ten months into a 12 month deployment Joshua was severely injured
                               during an engagement with Taliban. His injuries resulted in an amputation of a leg,
                               PTSD, and a long strenuous road to recovery. After rehabilitation, Joshua’s
                               yearning for adventure reignited and he moved to Orlando to pursue a higher education
                               at the University of Central Florida.
                               <br><br>
                               Joshua's passion for Floating emerged while undergoing therapy for PTSD in Orlando.
                               While medications were seemingly ineffective to alleviate the anxiety and depression, a
                               friend suggested floating as an alternative method of relaxation that could result in mindful clarity and
                               peace. Soon after Joshua's first floating experience he was introduced to the wonderment of floating and an improved sense
                               well being. “Floating is liberating! It’s an exceptional way to refresh and improve my
                               disposition.” - Joshua Ben

                       <br>
                       <p>
                           Thomas was born and raised in Columbia, Missouri. The early years of his life were spent exploring the woods in his backyard, rocking out on his drum set, and building elaborate Lego fortresses. In the formative years of his early adolescence he was stricken with Crohn’s disease, which brought him to spend many grueling hours in doctors’ offices and hospitals. His teenage life was characterized by the throes of chronic illness, which he fiercely attempted to suppress, but to no avail.
                           <br><br>
                           His path to true healing began in his freshman year of college in an Honors Philosophy course which had but one main goal: to explore and better understand the nature of Love. Thomas soon discovered Buddhism and holistic medicine, which led him to make substantial changes in his lifestyle. He began to cultivate mindful awareness in his daily activities, and began to balance his physical, mental, and spiritual diets. Now a daily meditator, he has developed an ongoing practice of warmly embracing himself and others. A deliberate and conscious effort has been made in his life to shift from judging to appreciating, and to embrace adversity as his greatest teacher.
                           <br><br>
                           Thomas met Connor in a meditation group at Mizzou, and was immediately intrigued by the prospect of floating in sensory deprivation. He has since come to appreciate floating as a doorway to ever-deepening meditation and relaxation, and is excited to help share the numerous benefits with his local community.

                           <p>
                               Louie first heard about floating at 16 as he painted houses for a local business in his hometown in Columbia, Missouri. Fast forward 7 years: Louie met Connor through the University of Missouri meditation group, Breathe.  It wasn’t long before Connor introduced Louie to his first float at Metamorphosis Float Tank & Massage Studio in Illinois. Louie was instantly hooked; he found flotation to be one of the most relaxing experiences he’d ever done. As Louie floated more, he began to recognize floating as a valuable tool for both his own inner struggle and also could see it as a valuable therapeutic tool for others.
                               <br><br>
                               Louie has his earned bachelor degrees in both Psychology and Anthropology, traveled extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East, developed his own daily meditation and yoga practice, and established a float practice using the float tank Connor and Louie share as roommates.  Currently, Louie works in Psychological Laboratory at the University of Missouri, studying mindfulness and meditation in addition to facilitating at Clarity Float Spa.  When he isn’t working, Louie can be found drumming, planning his next international adventure, growing vegetables, practicing yoga, meditation and flotation.
                               <br><br>
                              Louie believes that the float tank experience offers a very intimate look within oneself and can lead to greater self-awareness and growth, particularly when combined with meditation and yoga practice.  Louie has his sights set on graduate studies in the healing arts and hopes to own his own therapeutic center, which will absolutely offer a float tank.

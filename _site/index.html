                <h2 class="section-heading text-center">What is floating?</h2>
                <p class="lead">Imagine yourself, completely weightless, floating like a lily pad on water. As if laying on a cloud, in an
                    almost zero-gravity state, the mind slowly dissolves into relaxation and tranquility. In the world of
                    floating, there is nothing to do but be there, simply breathing and basking in quietude. Our float devices are
                    specially designed to create a near zero-gravity state and limited sensory environment. These two characteristics
                    create a unique space that allows our body and mind to rest, heal, and grow.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3 class="text-center">Why Float?</h3>
                <p class="lead">Floating has been clinically proven to provide a wide range of health benefits, and relieve many ailments 
                    -- especially stress, muscle tension, and pain.  <b><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0190292" 
                    target="_blank">One study</a></b> conducted in 2018 demonstrated floating regularly 
                    to be an effective method to relieve anxiety and depression, accompanied by “significant increases in serenity, 
                    relaxation, happiness and overall well-being."  We have seen people use their float practices to help recover 
                    from all sorts of emotional and physical stresses of life, and in some cases, even adopt a float practice as an 
                    alternative to pharmaceutical medications for managing pain and anxiety!  Whether you are seeking relief, physical recovery, or 
                    pure and simple relaxation, a float practice will deliver.

                    <p class="lead">It is our mission to provide the Columbia area with a space to experience nothingness.  Within this peaceful nothingness, we are able to rest and restore our minds and bodies to a deep state of calm.  When you take a moment to remove all distractions in your life, you can expose layers of clarity, tranquility, relaxation, and creativity that you may have never noticed before. Every float can ease you into this place of stillness, which promotes recovery from stress, pain, fatigue, anxiety, and more.  We have been deeply touched in our own lives by the many benefits of floating, and we are here to share those same benefits with you!

                <p class="lead">We have two different types of devices, each designed to meet different needs while still providing the same basic float environment.  The depth, temperature, and salt content of the water are the same in both types.  The differences are in how the lights work, and in the size of the devices.  In either case, you are free to leave the lights on for as long or as little as you’d like, although we encourage everyone to turn them off to receive the full restorative effects of floating.

                    <div>The Dream Cabin is our larger flotation device, tall enough to stand up inside and long enough for even the tallest people to stretch out comfortably. While the Dream Pods can feel almost womb-like inside, floating in a Cabin often feels more like floating through outer space.  The light offered in the Cabin is the same as in the pods (to turn it on press the button on the side wall).

                                We recommend arriving 20 minutes before your first appointment so that you can spend some time filling out some paperwork we have.  Also we have books and other things to look at while you wait.

                            After each float we run the filtration system which will pump the water through a mechanical filter for at least three cycles
                            while utilizing the combination of hydrogen peroxide and UV, which helps remove potential pathogens
                            from the water.

                            Always consult with your doctor first. Many pregnant women have claimed a greater sense of connection with their child during
                            the float experience as well as relief from the constant pressure and strain on your body that
                            growing a child can cause

                            There are at least 1,000lbs of epsom salt in each device which significantly increases the buoyancy and makes it nearly impossible
                            for your body to fall below the surface of the water. You float with ease on your back.

                            This is a very common topic for first time customers. People that have had this worry going into their first float usually
                            find that their sense of space is not bothered once inside the device with the lights off. If you
                            ever feel uncomfortable you can simply turn on the lights, stand up, and get out of the device
                            to collect yourself.

                                Connor found out about floating back in 2012 when he was in Kansas visiting his cousin. He was immediately intrigued and
                                booked a float at the Spa at Briarcliff. The next year when he was on vacation in Chicago
                                he booked two more floats. After his 3rd experience he realized this was definitely something
                                he wanted to make a part of his life.
                                <br>
                                <br> He had this idea of starting a float center when he was at Mizzou finishing his IT degree.
                                Around this time Connor was going through a transition in his life, moving away from ways
                                to escape and instead towards ways to accept life as it is. Over the next few years he found
                                peace in meditation and attended multiple 10 day silent meditation retreats. On these retreats
                                he started picturing what it would be like to own his own float device. This further encouraged
                                him to follow his passion of starting a float center.
                                <br>
                                <br> After he graduated from Mizzou he started working at Veterans United as a web developer
                                and bought a Zen Float Tent for at home floating. He started looking for spaces to open a
                                float center here in Columbia and came across Noah who was using the same realtor. Realizing
                                they shared similar values and ideas about what a float center should be, they decided that
                                opening a float center together would be the most sensible/logical thing to do.

                                Always aspiring to get the most out of life, Noah found floating to be the perfect tool for sensory reset and introspection.
                                With constant sensory overload in our everyday lives from phones, computers, TV, etc., being
                                able to jump into a float device and truly rest your mind and body was very enticing to him.
                                <br>
                                <br> After Noah’s first float, he was hooked! Pondering the installation of a personal device in
                                his home, Noah decided to look into bringing his passion for floating to central Missouri
                                by opening his very own float center. A few months later he was on a plane flying out to
                                Portland to go through a three day apprenticeship program with one of the most successful
                                float shops in the country.
                                <br>
                                <br> Absorbing an immense amount of knowledge over those three glorious days in Portland, Noah
                                began implementing his dream when he met Connor. Since then, they have eagerly been setting
                                plans in motion to open the doors to what they believe to be the ideal shop for the floating
                                experience. After living in Columbia for most of his life and getting so much out of the
                                great experiences this community has to offer, Noah is thrilled to bring his passion for
                                floating to the Columbia area to share with as many people as possible.

                                In 2015 Thomas' meditation practice brought him to BREATHE, a Mindfulness-based student organization on MU's campus. It was there that he met Connor, who first introduced him to the practice of floating. He was intrigued, gladly accepted an offer to try floating in Connor's in-home float tent, and was soon touched by the peaceful simplicity of floating.

                                <br>
                                Floating has since allowed Thomas to introspect, reflect, and find insight in an entirely new way along his path of growth and awakening. It has become an essential tool to his stress reduction and health maintenance, allowing him to take much-needed breaks from the doings of the external world and instead tend to the Being of his internal world.  Floating has allowed him to see exactly where he’s at in life, and be okay with wherever that is.

                                Thomas is a local, born and raised in Columbia. A former mindfulness educator on behalf of BREATHE and MU's Health & Wellness Center, contemplative practice remains integral to his self-care routine.  Outside of Clarity, his hobbies include reading, drumming, cooking, and inspiring positive change.  A lifelong drummer, he moves through life with rhythm and presence, with an oft renewed intention to make the most of his precious time here.  Thomas feels both honored and privileged to call Clarity Float Spa his home away from home, and is dedicated to spreading the many benefits of floating throughout the local community.

                                In 2014, Zac was led to floating in a way similar to many others; after years of struggling with generalized anxiety, a panicked, “best ways to treat anxiety” Google search ensued. After hastily scrounging through all of the Buzzfeed-esque self-help articles, it seemed as though he had finally found what he was looking for: an environment which minimizes all external stimuli, truly allowing him to dive deep into his mind in order to gain a better understanding of its anxious machinations. He knew as soon as the concept was introduced to him that floating was going to be a part of his life one way or another, he just didn’t quite know how (or when).
                           
                                <br>
                                <br> 
                                Zac joined the Clarity team in May 2019. When he saw the opportunity to get involved, he jumped at the chance, not only eager to hop in the float device, but also eager to begin working with the Clarity team to aid in their mission to bring floating to the community here in Columbia. He still struggles with anxiety, but also celebrates his triumphs in its moments of defeat after a long mental health journey. 

                                <br>
                                <br> 

                                Once he was acquainted with the float device, he quickly realized that there is much more to floating than anxiety relief. He discovered an opportunity to be wholly analytically introspective, allowing immense positive personal growth thus far. Floating for him has been a veritable multi-tool for personal care, and he looks forward to seeing how his float practice grows with him.

                    <h3>Why do we offer Infrared Sauna?</h3>

                    <h4>
                        <br> In October 2019 we expanded our wellness services to include a Cedar Infrared Sauna.  We chose infrared heat therapy over a traditional sauna because the infrared heat is able to penetrate deeper into the body than hot air or steam, allowing for deeper detoxification and more health benefits.  Better yet, infrared saunas achieve this effect at only 120-140F, whereas traditional saunas run between 180-210F.  With adequate hydration a person can safely tolerate infrared heat levels for up to 40 minutes.  Our sauna uses nano-carbon heaters, which have been tested and shown to produce little-to-no EMFs.

                    <p class="lead" style="margin-top:0">A growing body of research supports the health benefits of massage therapy to reduce stress, boost mental health and wellness, manage pain, and increase range of motion.  Massage can help reduce muscle tension, improve exercise
                        performance, and prevent injuries.  It can also help improve mood and reset circadian rhythms, which can lead to better sleep and more energy.  Floating before a massage helps maximize these benefits, just as getting a massage immediately before floating maximizes the benefits of the float!  For these reasons, we are now offering this powerful wellness combo here at Clarity Float Spa.</p>

                                    Robyn's journey into the healing arts began with a class in Chinese Medicine and Five Element Theory.  That opened the door,  the urge to walk through was overwhelming, and so it began.  Her studies continued with an intensive training with the San Francisco based East/West institute and Dr. Effie Chow in 2012, and the following year she completed her coursework in Jefferson City and became a Licensed Massage Therapist.  She is fascinated with anatomy, and the technical aspects of massage, yet intuitive and sensitive to the energetic component as well.  
                                    <br><br>
                                    Robyn has continued her education with studies in Deep Tissue for Relaxation, Dynamic Intuition, Myofascial Release, Working with Clients with Trauma, Reiki, and Acupressure.  Mother of two, her free time is precious, but when she finds it she does Tai Chi, is a Singer/Songwriter, and spends as much time outdoors as possible.
